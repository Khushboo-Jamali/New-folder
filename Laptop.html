The MacBook Air 15 fills a gap in Apple's laptop lineup, a big screen that doesn't cost you $2,500+.</h2></tr>

                <h3>It's just a bigger MacBook Air M2 is a perfectly reasonable complaint about the MacBook Air 15,<br> other than a slightly larger battery and of course the 15.3-inch display, Apple didn't change anything for the first larger Air.
                However, the good news is that Apple didn't slam you with a significant price bump either. The MacBook Air 15 <br> delivers everything that was excellent about the MacBook Air 13 M2 while giving you almost an extra hour of battery life and a 1.7-inch larger display, starting at $1,299.
                That's a solid value, particularly when you consider getting a MacBook with a 15-inch+ display has historically cost you $2,500 or more. Finally we have an affordable big-screen MacBook that delivers all of the performance that the average user needs for work, school, or general use.
